# Trading_algorithm

The application runs a conditional trading algorithm which exectues orders based on DMAC. It also evaluates the accuracy and returns of the program over a series of trades over daily closing stock prices. The application is also enhanced with a machine learning model which adapts to new data and improves the performance of the trading strategy. 

What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

  -Decresing the SMA window might result in less trading opportunities as larger windows detect longer trends
